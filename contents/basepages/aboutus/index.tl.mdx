### the beginning

When I got married, I realized that I had no future as a company employee.
I decided to start a side business of making handmade products.

Since I was a child, I have been making things, drawing pictures, taking photographs, making small films, and performing on stage in theater.
Because I love creating things.

### You never know until you try

<footnote>When I was worried about not selling</footnote>
</ImageBox>

However, to my surprise, it did not sell at all. In the first place, you can't even see the product page.

I was very particular about it and spent a lot of time making it, but I was worried about why no one was interested.
I was selfish and even felt resentment, thinking that if people could hold it in their hands, look at it, and use it, they would understand how good it is.

But I can't afford to open a store.
I had no choice but to sell it online.
Now you can't even pick it up.

### Try to change your mind
- "A change in perspective is worth 80 IQ points." -- Alan Key (A father of personal computer.)<br/>
  "A change of perspective is worth 80 points of IQ." -- Alan Kay, father of the personal computer

So I started studying online marketing.
I am studying business administration and software engineering at university.
It's because I've been doing internet related work for a long time.

Also, rather than trying various superficial methods, I thought that exploring fundamental and holistic methods would provide me with long-lasting knowledge.
If you use a superficial method, when the situation changes, you have to study from scratch again...

### Meet the right way for small shops

Then, many small shops and companies cannot sell because
I realized that it was because I imitated TV commercials and magazine advertisements for large companies.
In other words, there was a method of advertising, publicity, and sales that was optimal for the size of the store and the size of the trade area.

It's called DRM (Direct Response Marketing).
Moreover, it is similar to the way of thinking and way of thinking that was done in traditional Japanese business.

Do you know Drucker, who is famous for "Moshi Dora"?
It is said that Echigoya in the Edo period started the world's oldest marketing.

So, if you are Japanese, the content of my Google Maps attracting customers using DRM and DRM is
It's all about the things that make sense honestly.

However, when applying the Internet,
Internet and computer knowledge are required.

It's not easy for anyone to use.

### Meet Google Maps, easy to use on your smartphone

However, it is ideal for small local shops,
Anyone can use it easily with a smartphone,
And I found out about free Google business profiles.
Google business profile
It is a tool to manage the information of the shop placed on Google Maps.

In fact, at that time and now, in Japan, it increases the search ranking of Google Maps
Even if there is information on "MEO (map engine optimization) measures",
There is not much information that actually leads to the store from there.

Therefore, I decided to obtain information in English from overseas at that time.
It turns out that the word "MEO" is unique to Japan and was not used overseas.

Instead, Google officially used "Local SEO"
(Even if there is a search engine,
There is no such thing as a map engine. )

Local SEO is not local SEO.
It's a local search engine optimization.
Again, this is confusing, but the English word "local" doesn't seem to mean rural or country.
Ultimately, it is a pair of words for global (whole), and it seems that regional and local are more appropriate.

Then I started researching local SEO and started attracting customers on Google Maps.


  Because I want to spread the way to let you know
* If you make a mistake in notifying, not only will customers not come,
  because i lose money
