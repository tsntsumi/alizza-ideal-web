## Do you know why registering on a word-of-mouth site doesn't lead to acquiring customers?

Look at these two graphs.

<ImageBox alt="Owner survey" image={1} maxWidth="300px" width="80%">

<ImageBox alt="Customer survey" image={2} maxWidth="300px" width="80%">

</ImageBox>

<clear />

This is the result of a questionnaire survey conducted in June 2022 by Table Check Co., Ltd.

Nowadays, word-of-mouth sites (so-called gourmet sites) that restaurants are focusing on are no longer used by most customers of all ages.

Moreover, the customer's trust is now declining.
There are many bad rumors about word-of-mouth sites, such as unreliable reviews and restaurants paying money to improve their rank.

Instagram is also a hot topic as a tool for attracting customers to restaurants.

It's still used very little.

Instead, customers use Google Search and Google Maps.

Moreover, it is worth noting that few restaurants use it to attract customers.

Now, if you use Google search and Google Maps, your store can become the most popular store in your area.

The target of the survey is restaurants, but if you look at the contents, it is certain that the same trend will be observed at beauty salons and treatment clinics other than restaurants.

## Do you know why your profit margin decreases when customers come from word of mouth sites?

There is a word coupon refugee.

Such people move from place to place in search of restaurants that offer coupons with the best discount rates on word-of-mouth sites.

Those people never repeat.
The only way to stop it is to lower the discount rate.

If you own a store, you know that your store has repeat customers.

Even if customers come to us from word-of-mouth sites, if they are not repeat customers, we have to collect new customers.

For that reason, if you advertise on word-of-mouth sites at a high price, you will fall into a vicious cycle in which the unit price per customer will not increase no matter how long you stand.

However, now Google is offering 60,000 yen worth of Google advertising credits to users of Google Business Profiles.

With Google Ads, you can advertise your restaurant by specifying the area where the customer lives, age group, and interests.

Moreover, recently, using AI, it has become possible to display advertisements only to customers who are most likely to be interested in your store.

No need for troublesome settings.

Why not consider Google Ads?

## Do you know why Instagram is not for small restaurants?

Instagram is very popular with restaurant owners.
It ranks second after review sites.

<ImageBox alt="Owner survey" image={1} maxWidth="300px" width="80%">

</ImageBox>

<clear/>

Moreover, the number of restaurants that are about to start is approaching the number of restaurants that are about to register on word-of-mouth sites.

The only problem is that there are competing restaurants all over the country on Instagram.

It would be nice if customers within a radius of several kilometers from the store could see it, but we had to compete with stores nationwide that already have many followers.

Of course, there are tricks to creating content that will get you more followers.
It's really a little trick, but few people notice it.

Last year, there was an excellent company in Osaka that started to attract customers online to focus on the Internet from now on.
In Osaka, it was a medium-sized company that was making a profit.

However, when I started, my competitors spread all over the country, so I could not take orders at all, and I went bankrupt in just half a year.

You too should start preparing properly so that it doesn't happen.

## Do you know why you can't let your guard down even when the corona crisis is over?

Finally, the number of new corona infections has been reduced.
Recently, some people say that it has become the same as the common cold because it is less likely to become severe even if you do get it.

Indeed, until the appearance of the new coronavirus, when influenza was prevalent every year, not a few people became seriously ill.

The new corona will also be able to hit the vaccine every year in the same way as the flu.
The new corona vaccine is said to be half effective in half a year.

but please wait a moment.
I made a chronology of disasters that are said to occur once every 100 years.

import { CenturyDisasterInTheWorld, CenturyDisasterInJapan } from "../../../src/references/once-in-a-century-disasters"

<div><CenturyDisasterInTheWorld /></div>

A once-in-a-century disaster that affects Japan is happening once every 10 years.

Now let's turn our attention to Japan.

<div><CenturyDisasterInJapan /></div>

### A global food crisis is about to happen

Around March 2022, the government purchase price for imported wheat increased by 14%.

This is partly because Ukrainian and Russian wheat cannot be harvested or exported because of the war.

Moreover, wheat fertilizer was imported from Russia all over the world. As a result, there is a worldwide shortage of wheat.

### If you don't have bread, why don't you just eat rice?

Rising fertilizer prices are also hitting Japanese rice farmers hard.

Next year, the prices of not only wheat but also rice, vegetables, and many other crops will rise more than this year.

## What is the best way to attract customers?

<ImageBox image={3} float="right" />

As explained in the first question of the quiz, Google Business Profile is promising now.

Google Maps displays nearby restaurants from the GPS of the person searching.

In other words, if a person who wants to eat yakiniku from now on searches for "yakiniku restaurants near me", a list of really nearby yakiniku restaurants will be displayed.

People who want to eat yakiniku from now on, and people who don't.
People who are near your restaurant and people who are more than an hour away from your restaurant.

Which one will come to the restaurant?

Of course, you want to be nearby and eat yakiniku.

Moreover, Google Maps will display the route to the store just by tapping.

<clear/>

<ImageBox image={5} float="left" />

In addition, Google favors businesses that have a Google Business Profile over word-of-mouth sites and displays them at the top.

Even if it is displayed at the bottom of the search results, the restaurant will not be displayed.

This is zero yen customer acuisition.

In other words, you can get more people to find your restaurant than paying advertising fees on word-of-mouth sites or spending money on your own site to take SEO measures.

## Are you having suffers with your Google Business Profile?

1. What should my restaurant start with?
2. I'm already doing it, but why isn't it working?
3. Will I be able to continue on my own?
