    There are only a few left in 2022, and most of the COVID-19
  support of the national and local governments has ended.

    However, near the end of October, the number of infected people
  has increased again, mainly in the city center.

    But the government's new COVID-19 support is already low.

    At the House of Councilors Accounts Committee in June, Liberal
  Democratic Party member Norimi Onoda told Prime Minister Kishida, I
  asked the parliament to lower the COVID-19 infectious disease
  to 5, The answer was "reduction is not realistic".  And we're still
  here.

    If it cannot be lowered to category 5, infected people and close
  contacts will I can't go out for a few days.

    In other words, toward the end of the year, many people will avoid
    infection and refrain from going out.

    Before that happens, use your free Google Business Profile to
  Let's grow sales with boom.

## Guide local customers to stores

### Would you like to start attracting customers on Google Maps?

<ImageBox alt="Map Search Results"
 image={1} float="right" />

<div style={{marginBottom:"2em"}}><center style={{fontSize: "1.8em", fontWeight: "bold", fontFamily: "monospace"}}>&lt;Your region&gt;  &lt;Your industry&gt;</center></div>

<div style={{marginBottom:"2em"}}><center>First, search for ⬆ on your smartphone. </center></div>

What if the result was something like this??? ➡

You can use Google Maps to attract local customers to your store.

And what if your store was displayed at the top of the results?

Don't you think you can attract a lot of local customers?
In fact, there are a number of shops that are using Google Maps to increase the number of visitors by 3 to 10 times.

At the nail salon that I support,
In the first week after starting Google Maps measures,
A new customer came to the store for the first time in 2 years.

Google Maps is almost common sense in restaurants.
Now, people in this kind of store business are also producing results.

- beauty salon, nail salon
- Treatment clinic, chiropractic clinic, massage parlor
- Construction shop, used car shop

However, there are not many restaurants that have been going there for a long time that are using it effectively.
how about your shop?

<clear/>

## How did Google Maps acquire so many customers? 3 reasons

### Reason 1: 97% of people looking for a store are looking for it on Google search

<ImageBox alt="97% google map users" image={3} float="right" >
Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@hjkp?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText">henry perks</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/google-search?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a>
</ImageBox>

In fact, until about two years ago, even if you searched for "region + industry",
Google Maps was not showing up in Google Search.

But now, if you search for "region + industry", Google Maps will be displayed.
And about 97% of users looking for a store are looking for it using Google Maps.

In other words, by taking measures against Google Maps, you can appeal your shop to many people in the area.

Despite the fact that customers can buy it at online shops and Amazon,
I still want to see the real thing and buy it with confidence.

So you can even win back the customers who have become accustomed to shopping online.

<clear/>

### Reason 2: Because it is displayed higher than portal sites and company sites

<ImageBox alt="Effective for appeal" image={4} float="right" >
<div class="credit">Your store appears higher than the portal site store</div>
</ImageBox>

If you search with keywords such as "area + industry" that people looking for shops search,
Google Maps is at the top of the search results.

The majority of users of Google Maps are people who are looking for a shop right now.

In other words, pay an advertisement fee on the portal site and post it,
Rather than spend money on your own site and take SEO measures,
You can get more people to find your shop.

<clear/>

### Reason 3: Because you can appeal to customers the most right now

<ImageBox alt="Appeal to customers now" image={5} float="right" >
<div class="credit">Tap the search result to get immediate guidance with the car navigation system</div>
</ImageBox>

Why can you attract customers with Google Maps measures?
This is the biggest reason.

Most people who use Google Maps
"People who are looking for shops now".
In other words, you can appeal your yakiniku restaurant to people who want to eat yakiniku right now.


Appealing to people who want to eat yakiniku now,
It appeals to people who don't want to eat yakiniku...
Do you know which ones you can attract?

This is why Google Maps can attract customers.

<clear/>

## <center>But there's a problem...</center>

### <center>There is no meaning if it is not displayed at the top</center>

<ImageBox alt="Top 3 Packs" image={6} float="right" />

Although it is a Google Maps countermeasure with so many benefits, not everyone can benefit from it.
For example, if you search for "Shinagawa Yakiniku", you will get about 80 hits on Google Maps alone.

If your shop is displayed as the 80th...
You probably won't be able to attract customers from Google Maps.

But if your shop is displayed first... you can expect a lot of customers.

This is because most people look at the top of the search results.

So if you want to attract customers with Google Maps measures,
You have to make it appear higher in Google Maps.

And if you achieve a high search ranking with this Google Maps measure,
If you want to attract a lot of local customers...,

<clear/>

### <center>I have good news.</center>

That is our service that we are going to show you from now on...

## <center>Win alone in the commercial zone<br/>Gather local ladies with customers<br/>GoogleEntire package that attracts customers with a map</center>

In order to attract local customers to your store, all of Google Maps measures,
We will take care of the whole thing.

So what is it about? Please allow me to elaborate.

### Entire 1: Take care of all the troublesome account opening and initial settings

In order to take measures against Google Maps,
A Google service called Google Business Profile under your business name
You have to make it work.

We will take care of the account opening and initial settings for you.

### Entire 2: Perform weekly update work

One of the important elements in Google Maps measures is regular updates.

In fact, the content is only updated regularly,
Google will give you preferential treatment, saying, "This store must be a good one."

Therefore, we will take care of the update work once a week.

### Entire 3: Posting the most effective videos on your behalf

<ImageBox alt="movie shooting" image={7} float="right" />

With the implementation of 5G, the world has entered the era of big video.
Especially young people, without reading the text,
Getting information from videos has become the norm.

Therefore, instead of updating only photos and text, about once a month,
We will also be posting videos.

Of course, I will visit your shop and shoot the video to be posted,
We'll edit it before you post it, so it doesn't take any effort on your part.

### Entire 4: Review countermeasure agency to become the best in the commercial area 

<ImageBox alt="word of mouth" image={8} float="right" />

Word of mouth is a very important factor in attracting customers, not limited to Google Maps measures.

However, if you don't take any action from here, you won't be able to make a word of mouth.

Therefore, we also act as a proxy for review countermeasures so that customers who visit the store can write a review.
You just use the tools I prepare, so it doesn't take much effort.
Please do not worry about that.

* Recently, many vendors are taking measures to "service 00 if you
  leave a word of mouth" as a countermeasure against word of mouth.
  However, this is a violation of Google's terms of service, so it is
  a very risky method.  If there is a trader who is doing such a
  backwork, there is also a risk that the account will be frozen due
  to a violation of the terms.  Never use such companies.  Please be
  assured that my review measures are legitimate measures that do not
  violate the rules.

<clear/>

### Entire 5: Post articles effective for promoting store visits

<ImageBox alt="Post example" image={9} float="right" >
Posted article example：Entire service client (Nail Salon)
</ImageBox>

Google Maps measures are

- Posting photos
- Posting videos
- Anti-word of mouth measures
- Menu Table

And so on.

Even so, I can't write an effective article post that accurately connects prospective customers to the store.

For example, during the promotion period, you can't announce the campaign by posting only photos, right?
Therefore, in order to maximize such opportunities, I aim to publish about three movies a month.
Post articles optimized for Google Maps.

Of course, I will write the article, so don't worry.

The photo is an example of an article posted on Google Maps for a nail salon that I work for.
When I posted it in March, 299 people viewed it,
Four people were interested and clicked on the article.

In addition, setting flow lines to the homepage, registering products, managing coupons, etc.
We will take care of everything necessary for Google Maps countermeasures.

You can concentrate on store management without worry.

## <center>But wait a minute! <br/>That's not all</center>

### <center>Submit Monthly Reports<br/>Reliable Service</center>

<ImageBox alt="monthly report" image={10} float="right" />

If you use my service,
Don't you worry if you don't know how many customers you were able to attract from Google Maps?

But don't worry.
A report will be submitted once a month.

- How many customers were you able to attract from Google Maps?
- How many visits?
- How many route searches?
- How many times is the photo displayed?
- etc

If you feel that the numbers are not good, you can stop immediately,
Above all, by knowing the numbers, you can continue to take measures against Google Maps with peace of mind.

Even if my clients know how many people are displaying photos every month,
He said that he suddenly felt motivated.

Until then, no one is interested in the store...? It seems that I was worried about it.

<clear/>

## <center>Pricing</center>

Now for the price of this service.

But before that, I want you to think about something.
Many companies that have taken measures against Google Maps,
It means that we have achieved 3 to 10 times more customers.

If you think so, don't you think the price of this service is cheap even if it's 100,000 yen per month?
But today you don't have to pay that amount.

The fee for using this service is...

### <center><span style={{color: "red", fontSize: "1.4em", fontWeight: "bold"}}>2</span>0,000 yen / month (excluding tax)</center>

* However, the contract will be a contract for 3 months.

With this price alone, if sales rise from several tens of thousands of yen to several million yen every month,
Don't you think it's a cheap investment?

at least

- Portal sites that are becoming less effective
- SEO measures that are not displayed at the top
- Net advertising with poor cost-effectiveness
- A leaflet where the reaction ends only at that time

Wouldn't it be a much more cost-effective investment than spending money on something like that?

### but……

I can understand your feelings of reluctance and anxiety about
continuing to pay 20,000 yen a month for measures that you have never
done before.

Therefore, this time, we have prepared a special proposal for you.

## <center>Register by October 28th<br/>First 3 months at 50% off</center>

<div><ImageBox image={11} float="right" style={{backgroundColor: "#e0ebeb", borderWidth:0}} alt="Special Offer" /></div>

If you <strong>today</strong> apply for this service, for the first 3
months only,

### <center>20,000 yen per month `->` 10,000 yen per month</center>

If you can't feel the effect in the first 3 months, you can stop the
contract on the spot. There is very little risk for you with this.

* If you continue after the 3rd month, the regular price will be
  applied and the contract will be renewed every 3 months.

### And as an added bonus, the website that sells is also half-price!

In addition, our website design service that sells is available for 50,000 yen, a 50% discount from the usual price of 100,000 yen.

It is not just a one-page price.
Our Website Creation Service offers a selling website that specializes in attracting customers.

The service also includes coupon distribution and automatic email delivery to customers.
The service is available free of charge per month.

## <center><strong>Now</strong>, You have three ways</center>

### The first way is to "do not take measures against Google Maps"

In this case, probably rivals are doing more and more Google Maps measures,
We will accelerate the acquisition of customers from the Internet.

In the future, the importance of attracting customers from the Internet will only increase, so when I realized it, it was too late.
If you choose this path, that may happen.

### The second way is to "do your own Google Maps measures"

If you are enthusiastic about attracting customers, you may be able to get results someday if you continue to take steady measures.
But that “someday” is something that no one knows when it will come.

Moreover, it is very difficult to continue to take measures to attract customers while operating the usual store.

Also, you have to learn the know-how to get results.

### The third way is the way to "use this service of mine"

This road is the shortest and fastest way to attract customers from Google Maps.

Of course, just because you used my service,
We cannot guarantee 100% success.
But at least than you can do it yourself
I promise you a much higher chance of success.

Because if you're a hairdresser, just like you're a professional cutting hair,
Because I'm a Google Maps pro.
