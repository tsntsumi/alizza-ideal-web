## What to deliver; what is my product?

Last time, the time before last, in the main battlefield of delivery
form, We decided to have companies and individuals who want to eat
bento on special occasions buy it.

By the way, as of now (early November 2022), Japan is terrified of the 8th wave of COVID-19.

The other day, a high school suddenly canceled a school trip due to
the nationwide increase in COVID-19 infections.

The high school turned back the school excursion bus carrying the
students who had just left, and canceled their hotel reservation on
the same day.

I'm glad I decided to make it a delivery instead of eat-in...

Well, this time, I'm going to think about what the customer will buy.

Before that, let's think about why customers buy bento on special occasions.

### Why companies buy

Consider the situation in which a company buys a bento.

- At end-of-year parties and New Year parties, the president wishes to congratulate his employees and express his gratitude.
- To convey respect as a company to important customers and executives
- When training a large number of staff, with the comfort and expectations of the company
- When commemorative events are held, the company expresses its gratitude to its employees.

By the way, the one who chooses and orders the bento is not the imaginary persona of the company, but the person in charge who is usually entrusted with the chores.

And he/she buy a bento that will be praised for choosing a good one.

### Why people buy

Why do individuals ask for delivery?

- At the time of the memorial service, everyone remembers the deceased
- When the family returns home, to convey the joy of reunion
- At the celebration of longevity, we celebrate the safety so far
- At the award ceremony, to reward the hard work so far
- At entrance and graduation ceremonies, to convey expectations and wishes for the future

### What will be chosen for the special day?

The delivery bento chosen on a special day,
It is a bento that conveys the heart of the person who chooses it.

If so, would a cheap bento be chosen?

Many people would choose an expensive bento.
Even if it's not expensive, I'm sure they'll choose a bento that looks expensive.

For example, like Tokiko Kato's song,
A poor painter would give her beloved actress a million roses.

The painter chose a large number of gorgeous flowers to convey his thoughts.
It was not a flower that bloomed in any vacant lot.

So what do my customers buy?
It is a high-class bento.

Luxury does not mean expensive.
My customers don't buy just expensive bento.
they want to convey their thoughts properly,
they buy a bento that looks **high-class and delicious**.

## Bonus

A poor painter bought a million roses in the city.
BTW, a small rose flower costs 200 yen.

    200 yen ✕ 1,000,000 roses ＝ 200,000,000 yen

**200 million yen**! How poor!

## Well, the next success strategy for the delivery food business is...

This time, I considered what my customers would buy in the food delivery business.

Next, we will conduct market research.

Please look forward to it.
