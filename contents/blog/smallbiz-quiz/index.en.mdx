## Do you know why registering on a word-of-mouth site doesn't lead to attracting customers?

Look at these two graphs.

<ImageBox alt="Owner survey" image={1} maxWidth="300px" width="80%">

<ImageBox alt="Customer survey" image={2} maxWidth="300px" width="80%">

</ImageBox>

<clear />

This is the result of a questionnaire survey conducted in June 2022 by Table Check Co., Ltd.

Nowadays, word-of-mouth sites (so-called gourmet sites: a certain T-log site and a certain H-pepper site) that shops are focusing on are no longer used by most customers of all ages.

Moreover, the customer's trust is now declining.
There are many bad rumors about word-of-mouth sites, such as unreliable reviews and shops paying money to improve their rank.

Instagram is also a hot topic as a tool for attracting customers to shops.
It's still used very little.

Instead, customers use Google Search and Google Maps.

Moreover, it is worth noting that few shops use it to attract customers.

Now, if you use Google search and Google Maps, your store can become the most popular store in your area.

The target of the survey is restaurants, but if you look at the contents, it is certain that the same trend will be observed at beauty salons and treatment clinics other than restaurants.

## Do you know why your profit margin decreases when customers come from word of mouth sites?

There is a word coupon refugee.

Such people move from place to place in search of shops that offer coupons with the best discount rates on word-of-mouth sites.

Those people never repeat.
The only way to stop it is to lower the discount rate.

If you own a store, you know that your store has repeat customers.

Even if customers come to us from word-of-mouth sites, if they are not repeat customers, we have to collect new customers.

For that reason, if you advertise on word-of-mouth sites at a high price, you will fall into a vicious cycle in which the unit price per customer will not increase no matter how long you stand.

However, now Google is offering 60,000 yen worth of Google advertising credits to users of Google Business Profiles.

With Google Ads, you can advertise your shop by specifying the area where the customer lives, age group, and interests.

Moreover, recently, using AI, it has become possible to display advertisements only to customers who are most likely to be interested in your store.

No need for troublesome settings.

Why not consider Google Ads?

## Do you know why Instagram is not for small shops?

Instagram is very popular with shop owners.
It ranks second after review sites.

<ImageBox alt="Owner survey" image={1} maxWidth="300px" width="80%">
<center>How the store is focusing on attracting customers</center>
</ImageBox>

<clear/>

Moreover, the number of shops that are about to start is approaching the number of shops that are about to register on word-of-mouth sites.

The only problem is that there are competing shops all over the country on Instagram.

It would be nice if customers within a radius of several kilometers from the store could see it, but we had to compete with stores nationwide that already have many followers.

Of course, there are tricks to creating content that will get you more followers.
It's really a little trick, but few people notice it.

Last year, there was an excellent company in Osaka that started to attract customers online to focus on the Internet from now on.
In Osaka, it was a medium-sized company that was making a profit.

However, when I started, my competitors spread all over the country, so I could not take orders at all, and I went bankrupt in just half a year.

You too should start preparing properly so that it doesn't happen.

## Do you know why you can't let your guard down even when the corona crisis is over?

Finally, the number of new corona infections has been reduced.
Recently, some people say that it has become the same as the common cold because it is less likely to become severe even if you do get it.

Indeed, until the appearance of the new coronavirus, when influenza was prevalent every year, not a few people became seriously ill.

The new corona will also be able to hit the vaccine every year in the same way as the flu.
The new corona vaccine is said to be half effective in half a year.

but please wait a moment.
I made a chronology of disasters that are said to occur once every 100 years.

import { CenturyDisasterInTheWorld, CenturyDisasterInJapan } from "../../../src/references/once-in-a-century-disasters"

<div><CenturyDisasterInTheWorld /></div>

A once-in-a-century disaster that affects Japan is happening once every 10 years.

Now let's turn our attention to Japan.

<div><CenturyDisasterInJapan /></div>

Although it is localized, disasters occur almost every year, and local economies are damaged.

And now, a global food crisis is about to occur.
Around March 2022, the government purchase price for imported wheat increased by 14%.

This is partly because Ukrainian and Russian wheat cannot be harvested or exported because of the war.

In the United States and other countries, wheat fertilizers were mostly imported from Russia, which also had an impact.
As a result, the price of fertilizer for crops has also risen, and Japanese rice farmers have been hit hard.

If we don't have bread, we can just eat rice.

It is not hard to predict that the prices of many crops such as wheat, rice and vegetables will rise next year.
For restaurants, from the end of 2022 this year to the beginning of 2023 next year will be a game.

Moreover, the new school term started in September.
Many students must have gathered at the school.

And soon Silver Week.

Also, I hope the number of new corona infections doesn't increase toward the end of the year. . .

The trouble is not the number of infected people, but the rumor damage caused by the wide TV show.
If it hadn't been for the fear of the wide show, people wouldn't have refrained from going out in May.

Start preparing for next year now.

## What is the best way to attract customers?

<ImageBox image={3} float="right" />

As explained in the first question of the quiz, Google Business Profile is promising now.

Google Maps displays nearby shops from the GPS of the person searching.

In other words, if a person who wants to eat yakiniku from now on searches for "yakiniku restaurants near me", a list of really nearby yakiniku restaurants will be displayed.

People who want to eat yakiniku from now on, and people who don't.
People who are near your shop and people who are more than an hour away from your shop.

Which one will come to the store?

Of course, you want to be nearby and eat yakiniku.

Moreover, Google Maps will display the route to the store just by tapping.

<clear/>

<ImageBox image={5} float="left" />

In addition, Google favors businesses that have a Google Business Profile over word-of-mouth sites and displays them at the top.

Even if it is displayed at the bottom of the search results, the shop will not be displayed.

In other words, you can get more people to find your shop than paying advertising fees on word-of-mouth sites or spending money on your own site to take SEO measures.
