  Nowadays, the food and beverage industry such as restaurants and
  eataries are tough times.

    Even if the COVID-19 pandemic does not come, it is said that it will
  be difficult to keep on.

    You wonder if you can continue to live..., even if you closed your restaurant.

    However, 《with the equipment of your restaurant as it is》, 《with your current skills》, 《without laying off staff or parts》, 《**without changing the form of your restaurant**》, 《**you can expect growth**》, what do you think?

    If you are interested, please take a look at how I will be a sacrifice and trial and error in order to succeed in the shortest path.

Strategy and planning are the lights that illuminate the future in
business. When things don't go well, it's a clue to know where you are
now and whether you should keep going.

From now on, please take a look at "The Strongest Food and Beverage
Business Strategy I Thought of".

### Where to place the main battlefield; overlooking heaven, earth, and people

In the food-business, there are 3 forms such as eat-in, take-out, delivery forms.

* The disadvantage of eat-in is that if the COVID-19 misfortune
  recurs, it will be greatly damaged.

    The 8th wave is coming, or a new COVID-19 misfortune level
  disaster is coming.

    The world level once-in-a-century disaster has happened once every
  ten years in the last 30 years.

    Moreover, in Japan, disasters that have never happened before
  occur almost every year.

* The anxiety factor of takeout is that the lifestyle of consumers has
  changed due to the COVID-19disaster. This is the same for eat-in.

    The change in lifestyle means that remote work has become the norm
  for many office workers, and they no longer have to commute every
  morning and night.

    In other words, the majority of office workers stopped using the
  station. The habit of shopping on the way to work or picking up a
  lot before returning home is gone. It became rare to have lunch
  with colleagues during the lunch break.

    In other words, if you're going to open a restaurant from now on,
  it's better to find a place in the suburbs where parking is cheaper
  than setting up in front of a station or downtown.

* Delivery. Unlike the other two, it can also avoid to the impact of
  the COVID-19 disaster.

    And in a sense, it's a good trend that office-workers have stopped
  having drinking parties with their colleagues and bosses as a trend
  even before the COVID-19 disaster.

    Even at my previous workplace, the year-end party for the entire
  department had not been held for many years. Instead, on the day, we
  ordered the hors d'oeuvre in our work room.

    Demand for delivery of hors d'oeuvres and bento to companies will
  continue to increase.

    The issue is shipping costs. Many businesses are now seeing their
  profits squeezed by their Uber Eats. In fact, the problem is that Uber
  Eats' business model is not suitable for the COVID-19 crisis.

    Therefore, in the early days of the store, it's a good idea to make
  your own deliveries.

It is necessary to examine the merits and demerits of the above three
forms and select one. I can combine them, but I think I'll focus on
one here. It makes it easier to concentrate power.

Eat-in can hope for a big return in the upcoming year-end and New Year
sales season. However, as I wrote in the consideration of eat-in and
take-out above, the risks are also great.

Take-out is basically eat-in, and there is an image of supporting each
other. It doesn't matter if you like it or not, but it doesn't seem
like you can pour your passion into it.
Without passion, business continuity is difficult.

So, the delivery remained by elimination method.

## BTW, what is the next success strategy for the delivery food business?

In this episode, I've been dealing with a boring, delusional story
that is full of nonsense.

In the next episode, he will delve into the delivery strategy that sells.

It seems that the story that has not yet been put into practice will
continue, but please look forward to it.

### Bonus

This is a chronological table of the once-in-a-century level disasters
mentioned above. In Japan, it seems that the hard situation will
continue.
