  Are you dissatisfied with your website?

   - No one asks from your website
   - I took SEO measures as instructed by the company, but it did not rise to the top of the search results
   - I feel like no one is looking at my website

  That's right, this is the billboard of the website.
  Like a real sign, it fades, peels off,
  No one has noticed.

  But what if your website wasn't just a billboard, but your personal sales representative?

## If the homepage became your sales person

If your website becomes your exclusive salesperson,
Don't you think this will happen?

* Inquiries from the homepage are stable
* Moreover, the closing rate is high
* More time to spend with clients because you are in charge of sales
* That's why customers are satisfied
* More private time
* Keep your family happy

Such a homepage, it is a **official site** type homepage.

Providing specialized knowledge and technology,
Communicate with customers with trust and sincerity
It is especially recommended for **professionals**.

## If the homepage works only as a billboard

A lot of people regret that they made a homepage, but they didn't do a great job.

But if I quit the homepage, it would be worse...

With that in mind, I reluctantly continue to pay maintenance fees.

An acquaintance of mine also made a homepage when things were going well.
But even though I pay tens of thousands of yen every month for maintenance...

- I changed my phone number, but it hasn't been updated
- Inquiries from the inquiry form are not notified
- We pay more maintenance fee than rental server fee
- It is blocked by the browser because it does not support HTTPS yet
- And I can't stop because of my ties

I'm in trouble because it's a series of things like that.

## Official site type? What's the difference?

The difference between the official website type and the common general type homepage is the content of the homepage, the order of communication, and what kind of person it is sent to.

In the official site type, we will tell you in the order based on the psychology of the person who reads the homepage.

However, the general type of website created by many production companies does not consider the order or lacks the essential content that leads to inquiries.

This is because such a website estimates how much a page equivalent to A4 size will cost.
If you think of the homepage as a leaflet, a signboard, or a flag, it would be reasonable.

There is no size limit on the homepage, so if you include this and that, there is no limit.

But please wait a moment.
The price of the homepage should be considered the same as the app for smartphones and computers.

In other words, you should base your pricing on what is necessary and sufficient to achieve your goals.

If you can't achieve your goals, no matter how cool your website is, isn't it worth the cost?

## Differences between the official website type and the general type &lt; common mistakes on the general type website &gt;

A common general type website suddenly displays a cool image, animates without meaning, and explains how good the service is.

What's wrong with that?

To make it easier to imagine, let's use a joint party as an example.
A homepage is similar to appealing yourself to a person who visits for the first time.

Then, what would happen if the partner of the joint party suddenly started appealing this kind of thing?

<ImageBox alt="Reject" image={4} float="right">

- How high your annual income is
- How famous and profitable your employer is
- How famous your university is and what celebrities have graduated from
- How big is your business partner
- how cool you drive
- How expensive your watch and accessories are
- How famous and expensive brands the clothes and bags you are wearing
- What a great acquaintance and how I raised him

How would you feel if you heard such boastful stories?

The homepage is the same.

However, it is a little different from a joint party.

In a joint party, it is difficult to leave in the middle.

But on the homepage, I stop reading there and easily fly to YouTube or Twitter.

Even if you write the content so that you can understand it if you read it all, you will stop reading on the way.

That is the drawback of a common general type homepage.

## Official site type website

<ImageBox alt="Official site type homepage as a filter" image={2}>

</ImageBox>

However, on the official site type homepage, I think about how the person reading is feeling now.

Then, gradually remove vague anxiety, doubts, distrust, suspicion, and hesitation about your service from the minds of people who visit your official website as you read on.

It purifies the interest in your services for prospective clients reading it.

So to speak, the official website is a "filter". In other words, arrange the funnels with filters in a well-thought-out order.

## But you can't do this

However, as Adlerian psychology says, you can't change people's beliefs and behavior.
You can't sell it to someone who doesn't want it.

You can't manipulate people's minds or brainwash them.

Therefore, the official website is not suitable for those who want to make a deal even if it means deceiving people.

## The end of the company that made a general type website

Here's an interesting statistic about the company that made a typical homepage.

According to the Small and Medium Enterprise Agency White Paper:

- Only about 14 out of 721 companies (1.9%) frequently receive new orders from their websites
- Only about 26 out of 505 companies (5.1%) answered that their website was effective.

In other words, only 2 out of 100 companies were able to acquire clients with a general type of website.

On the contrary, the presidents of 95 companies out of 100 regret making them.

## Another difference between official site type and general type

Another difference between the official site type is that it sharpens who to send to.

Be clear about who you want to serve and tell only one person what your website is about.

A common mistake in setting targets is to set something like "Men in their 30s".

But men in their early 30s and men in their late 30s have completely different tastes.
It also depends on whether you are married or have children.

Think about it in the matchmaking example from earlier.

Don't you like people who only look at you rather than people who are nice to everyone?

## Bring your website back to life

With the above in mind, please review the website.
Then, ask the production company to make improvements and revive the signboard website to your exclusive salesperson.

But I'm often asked these question.

- I want to improve, but I'm an amateur, so I don't know how to ask...
- The production company is a professional, so I have no choice but to leave it to you...
- Where is the problem in the first place...
- And I can't think of any concrete improvements...
