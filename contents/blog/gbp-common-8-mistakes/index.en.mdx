## GBP Mistake #1: Not optimizing your keywords for your location

### What's wrong?

Not only for GBP, but also for website SEO, etc., we often make the
wrong choice of keywords.

It is to choose keywords for a wide range of customers and keywords
for unspecified number of customers.

But I can understand your feeling.
advertisements and promotions that you often see on TV or in
magazines, you will think that there is no mistake.

However, such keywords are for the mass market.
for the national districts, not for local customers.

For example, most people choose keywords like "Best Lawyer".

Unfortunately, this keyword does not capture the interest and
Attention of customers in your area (in other words, your local area).

If you say "The Best Lawyer", local customers will think you are an
Ordinary lawyer anywhere in the country.

## GBP Mistake #2: No Reviews

### What's wrong?

Many presidents and store managers who started GBP, I don't think
about word of mouth only to the extent that "it's better to have it".

Do you agree that reviews are **not required**?

However, in GBP, there are positive reviews (And that there is a lot
of it) It helps a lot in ranking higher in Google searches.

## GBP Mistake #3: Mismatched NAPWs

### What's wrong?

NAPW is an acronym for four pieces of information:

- **N**ame (company name or shop name)
- **A** address (office or shop address)
- **P**hone No. (telephone number)
- **W**website (Your Website URL)

These information must match the information on the Internet other
than GBP.

This is the **NAPW** of your shop or company that is
posted on SNS or blogs.

Also, match it with real-world information.  Photos uploaded to GPB,
as seen in Google Street View, **NAPW** such as billboards.

Unfortunately, this mistake is the most common one.

For example, it often happens when:

- When you move your store or office
- When you change your phone number
- When you change your homepage or Wordpress address

In addition, there are other careless mistakes.

- "Building" in the address may be "Building" or "BLDG."
- The street name "XXX street" may or may not be added to the address
- The URL of the homepage may be mistyped
- The company name may contain an "and" ” is changed to “&” by the symbol

## GBP Mistake #4: Ignoring Negative Reviews

### What's wrong?

Unfortunately, negative and negative reviews The more customers come
to the store, the more likely it will be written.

Many presidents tend to ignore it.

However, if you leave such reviews unattended, your business will be
damaged.

- Note! Recently, a dubious company said, "I will teach you how to
  erase negative reviews."  Don't pay for it to
  such companies.  Please ignore.

## GBP Mistake #5: Leaving Duplicate Business Profiles


### What's wrong?


In rare cases, your business profile may be duplicated.

- You moved offices and didn't delete your old business profile
- The customer was kind enough to register before I knew it, but I made a new one.
- I didn't know how to operate, and I made a lot while doing it

And so on.

Either way, duplicate business profiles confuse customers as to which
information is correct.

Confused customers like that is what Google unlikes the most.
Because Google Maps itself may seem unreliable. If it is not trusted,
there will be no one to use it. 

Doing so will stop Google from making money from search ads.

Google makes money from ads in Maps and Search, you can use
your Google Business Profile for free.

## GBP Mistake #6: Not optimizing your photos

### What's wrong?

Have you uploaded a photo like this?

- Photos too dark or too bright
- The photo is out of focus
- Photo file size is too large

It's easy to see why it's not a good idea to not be able to see what's
in the picture because of the brightness and focus of the photo.

So, beautiful photos with large file size, high quality and high
resolution, Why not?  This is because it takes time for the customer
to view the photos.

Customers aren't just looking at your business profile from home with
WiFi. I often watch it on the go. And the more people who see it on
the go, the more likely they will come to the store.

In other words, when you get a little hungry while shopping or
driving, you search for nearby restaurants. 

Or maybe you suddenly have a stomach ache and want to go to the
pharmacy. I was inspired by the fashion of people I passed by and
looked up where they were sold.

If a customer doesn't see a photo, they'll likely stop looking and go
to another business profile.

## GBP Mistake #7: Stuffing Keywords

### What's wrong?

Are you stuffing your titles and descriptions with synonyms or similar
modifier keywords? That's wrong.

Google has been aware of the keyword stuffing problem for years now
and considers it a problem.

Simply because it's hard to read. Similar words are lined up in a row,
and it's hard to get to the information you want to know.

If your business profile is full of such things, Google search may not
be used.

That's why Google doesn't allow such business profiles to rank higher.

The technology to understand keywords and nuances from explanatory
text has been researched for more than 30 to 40 years.

In fact, at the laboratory of a certain factory where I worked, such
technology was being researched as part of artificial intelligence
research. More than 30 years ago, I created software for that
research.

## GBP Mistake #8: Not posting pictures regularly

### What's wrong?

<ImageBox alt="Photo Addings and Viewings" image={0} />

Once you registered your business profile on Google Maps, did you
leave it as is?

Google will rank up and show you higher in the search results if your
photos are added regularly.

For example, my client was closed for the year-end and New Year
holidays in 2021 and 2022, and if I didn't add any photos for a while,
the number of references would drastically decrease.

When I suggested adding a few photos at a time, it recovered
immediately.

However, it can be said that the reason why I recovered so quickly was
because I was uploading regularly until then.

This graph shows the relationship between the total number of photos
my clients have uploaded to their Google Business Profiles and the
number of views on Google Maps and Google Search.

Periods where the red line for the number of photos is horizontal
indicates that the photos were not uploaded. The rising red line
indicates that the photo has been uploaded.

As you add more photos, the blue line representing views rises as
well.

An increase in views means a higher ranking in Google Maps and Google
Search.

As you can see from these two graphs, if you have not updated your
business profile since registering it, you will find it difficult to
rank high.

And if your local rival is steadily updating it, it's even more so.
