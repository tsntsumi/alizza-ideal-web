  Last time, I decided where to make the main battlefield. It is a food delivery business.

    This time, decide who to deliver to.
  The first thing to decide, not only in the restaurant business, but in any business, is "who will buy what?"

    First, find people who will buy, and build products and services that meet their needs.
  This is important.

    Even if you imagine that this will sell, there are many things that are not accepted due to small things.

    On the other hand, even if something is not a big deal for you, it may be a treasure for some people.
  Look for what your customers believe to be treasure, not your own.

# Episode 2: Practice! Successful strategy for the bento business ~ Summary so far

Last time, [Tsutsumi decided his main battlefield](/blog/successful-bento-business).

He was afraid of the 8th wave of COVID-19 and the occurrence of a big disaster, so he avoided the eat-in form. And he chose the delivery form.

Thinking about who to deliver this time...

### Now, what about this story?

## Who do I deliver to; who are my customers?

Last time, I decided to fight in the battlefield of the delivery, out of the three forms of the food and drink business: eat-in, takeout, and delivery.

Let's narrow it down a little more this time. What will it deliver to whom?

Think about it in two parts. For businesses and individuals.

### Delivery demand for companies

Now companies (employees) are moving away from banquets.
We are choosing delivery instead of holding a banquet at a restaurant.

Companies ask for delivery not only for end-of-year parties and New Year's parties such as work payments.

- When an important customer visits the company
- During executive meetings
- When a large group of people gather for training
- For commemorative events such as foundation anniversary

There is a demand for bento that are ordered on special occasions, rather than bento that are eaten on a daily basis.

### Personal delivery demand

When do individuals ask for delivery?

If you think about it for a moment, you should buy a convenience store bento when you eat.
I wonder if there is a demand for delivery for such individuals.

However, there may not be as many people gathering as in a company, but there is a demand at times like this.

- At the time of the memorial service
- When distant family members return home
- Time to celebrate longevity
- When celebrating children's awards
- When celebrating a child's entrance to school or graduation

There is a demand for bento boxes ordered for special occasions for individuals as well as for businesses.

So, I decided to deliver to individuals and companies who order bento on special occasions.

## Well, the next success strategy for the delivery food business is...

This time, Tsutsumi considered who would buy it for food delivery business.

Next time, he will delve into what to buy for food delivery business.

Please look forward to it.
