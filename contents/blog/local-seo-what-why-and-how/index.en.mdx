# Local SEO if small shops attract customers; What? why? and How?

Hello everyone. I'm <b>Kikuo</b>@alizza-ideal.com, a local SEO specialist.

Local SEO is the optimization of Google's local search engine.
In Japan, many people misunderstand that it is the same as MEO.

However, Local SEO does much more than MEO.
You know, MEO is a term only in Japan.

## What's Local SEO

The region, city or neighborhood where your shop is located,
In other words, for customers living in your trade area,
When promoting your shop or products,
You will have to do SEO.

In doing so, Google's **local search** is essential.

Of course, it's not just customers who live in your trade area.  For
example, it includes customers who come to your trade area for
commuting, shopping, traveling, sightseeing, etc.

Simply put, Local SEO is about optimizing Local Search results.

As you know, SEO measures refer to the display order of search results
as ranking, and optimizing is the process of raising the ranking of a
website to the top.

In normal search (organic search), search results are simply a list of
titles and links.

Local searches, on the other hand, show map packs and local packs for
your business and products instead of your home page.

Local SEO is about optimizing their ranking and how they appear in the
results.

	            borderRadius: "0.5em"}} /></div>

## Organic SEO and local SEO are connected

Organic SEO is about optimizing the ranking of your homepage.
Moreover, it contributes to the ranking optimization of not only the
homepage but also the local pack.

If Google's search algorithm identifies organic searches near the
seacher or in a specific area, relevant local shops and products will
also be displayed in the search results.

In this way, organic SEO and local SEO are related to each other.

However, each optimization method requires a separate and independent
strategy.

# What is Local SEO!?

Local SEO is the practice of optimizing local search rankings.  In
other words, aim for the top ranking for local packs and map packs for
your store and its products.

Most people only show interest in the top 3-4 results.

In addition to being displayed at a higher rank, it is meaningless if
the link is not clicked.

However, if you open a Google business profile, your business
information will be displayed in the top ranking local pack.  The
person who searched can check the information of the store without
clicking.

## How does local search work?

<ImageBox image={1} float="right" alt="Local Pack in Local SEO" />

Did you search for anything when you were out recently?

Was it "men's shoes", "nursery school", or perhaps "co-working space"?

Google is on a mission to show accurate results for any search.

People will use Google search when it shows accurate results.  As more
people use Google search, more companies want to advertise on Google.

As a result, Google's profits will increase.

If Google's algorithm thinks you're searching for something nearby,
it'll show up higher and higher in the search results.  Above organic
search results.

Let's say you search for "mexican restaurant open now."

Then the list of Mexican restaurants will show up above the organic
search.

Google determined that you **want to go to a Mexican restaurant right now**, is another factor listed above.

Google decided that you wanted more local information than organic search results.

Local information is information such as:

- Shop name / Company name
- Address
- Phone number
- Home page
- Photo
- Video
- Reviews
- Number of Stars

## What should you do to make your shop rank higher?

A general best practice is to follow Google's [webmaster
guidelines](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/guidelines/webmaster-guidelines?hl=en) and to improve User experience.

Organic SEO is also an essential element to improve local SEO.
